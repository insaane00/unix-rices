## INSTRUCTIONS: Review every file and edit according to your system and/or
preferences. Most things here are specific to my system although I changed
some things to be more standard for the userbase.

## MY OWN SYSTEM SETUP (was used as a baseline for this config)

Terminal: st
Window manager: i3 (vanilla)
Editor: Vim
Networking: enp2s0, wlp3s0
Music system: mpd + ncmpcpp
Sound system: ALSA
Other programs: ranger, cli-visualizer
Fonts: lucy tewi for text, wuncon siji for icons. Get them here:
  https://github.com/lucy/tewi-font
  https://github.com/stark/siji
Init system: OpenRC

Look the following files:

.config/i3/config
.config/polybar/config
.config/redshift.conf
.config/mpd/mpd.conf
.config/ncmpcpp/config
.config/neofetch/config
.config/vis/config

## DON'T FORGET TO MAKE THE CONFIG FIT YOUR SETUP OR YOUR X SERVER MIGHT NOT BE
USABLE!!
